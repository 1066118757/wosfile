wos
===

**wos** is a Python package designed to read and handle data exported from Thomson Reuters Web of Scienceâ„¢. It supports both tab-delimited files and so-called 'plain text' files.

At the moment, **wos** does little more than reading WoS files and generating *Record* objects for each record.
